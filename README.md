Automated Email Delivery Script in Python
This Python script is designed to automatically send emails based on various triggers, such as GitHub events (e.g., push commits, issues, etc.) or other custom webhook events. It uses a Flask-based web server to listen for incoming HTTP POST requests, processes the received data, and then sends an email to a specified recipient with relevant information.

Key Features:
Email Integration: It uses the smtplib library to send emails, including SMTP authentication with a Gmail account (though it can be configured for other services).
Dynamic Email Content: Based on the event type, the content of the email can be dynamically adjusted to include relevant details like commit messages, issue titles, and other event-specific data.
